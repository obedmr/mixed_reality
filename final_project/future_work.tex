\section{Future Work}
As we start with a proof of concept, below we define the opportunity areas where we 
could improve the Travelex Application in order to make a greater impact on the 
implementation of Augmented Reality in Tourism Sector:\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Adding more touristic places 
  \item Enabling Explore capability that could let the users find more interesting 
        places that are not necessary near to him/her.
  \item Enabling 'Near Places' capability
  \item Adding feedback mechanism for letting users rate the destinations
\end{itemize}
